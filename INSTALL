First please consult the README to check that you have a new enough
version of Perl.

(N.B. the rest of this document looks a great deal more complicated
than it actually is, mainly because I'm trying to encourage people to
do the Right Things by using CPANPLUS instead of CPAN, and
Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker.)


"Automatic" installation via CPANPLUS.pm or CPAN.pm
=========================================================================

Ideally, use CPANPLUS.pm to install it, which is much nicer than
CPAN.pm (CPANPLUS will appear in Perl core in version 5.10, under an
as-yet undetermined name, and CPAN.pm will be deprecated).  

To install CPANPLUS.pm:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install CPANPLUS'

Then it should be as easy as:

  $ perl -MCPANPLUS -e 'install MySQL::Diff'

and you're done.

Alternatively, if you use a new-ish CPAN.pm which automatically
follows dependencies, the following might work:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install MySQL::Diff'

(The point to all of this is that the Class::MakeMethods::* suites get
installed, which MySQL::Diff depends on to run.)

Otherwise ...


"Manual" installation
=========================================================================

First ensure you have Class::MakeMethods::* installed.

Then there are two options:

1) Install via Module::Build (recommended)
--------------------------------------------

Ensure that Module::Build is installed, e.g.

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Build'

or

  $ perl -MCPANPLUS -e 'install MySQL::Diff'

Then run these commands:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

2) Install via ExtUtils::MakeMaker (deprecated but simpler)
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to install a private copy in your home directory, then you
should try to produce the initial Makefile with something like this:

   perl Build.PL config='lib=/home/me/perl'


And finally ...
=========================================================================

Note that the test suite will not run properly unless you have
a MySQL server which it can connect to.

If you want to use the command-line based front-end mysqldiff.pl, you
should copy it to somewhere on your $PATH.
